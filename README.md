# NLP-Final-Project

This is a recreation of the N-Hance pun detection system, which was created to solve task 7 of Semeval-2017.

The three subtasks which this system accomplishes are:

# Subtask 1: Pun detection.
For this subtask, participants are given an entire raw data set. For each context, the system must decide whether or not it contains a pun.

# Subtask 2: Pun location.
For this subtask, the contexts not containing puns are removed from the data set. For each context, the system must identify which word is the pun.

# Subtask 3: Pun interpretation.
For this subtask, the pun word in each context is marked, and contexts where the pun's two meanings are not found in WordNet are removed from the data set. For each context, the system must annotate the two meanings of the given pun by reference to WordNet sense keys.
